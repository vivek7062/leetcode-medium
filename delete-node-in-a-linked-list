// Question - https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/
// Answer in cpp


As given we don't have pointer of first not we are at current node which we need to delete so we need to delete current node we need previous pointer but here is not any previous pointer 
So we can do one thing
1-.>2->3->4->-5->null
suppose we want to delete node 3 and right now we are node 3
then we replace next value(4) with current value and delete next node
step 1 - 1->2->4->4->5->null (Replace)
step 2 - 1->2->4->5->null (delete next node)
So now can see we deleted current node


class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
       node->val = node->next->val;
       node->next = node->next->next;
    }
};
