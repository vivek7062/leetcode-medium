// Question - https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/
// Answer in cpp




Lets take an example to undersatnd this solution
Ex.  2 1 5 0 4 6
take two variable first = INT_MAX,second=INT_MAX
Now iterate whole array and check
if number is maximum of both number FIRST and SECOND then return true
and if number less than first then assign same number in FIRST
and if number morethan first then assign in SECOND
i=0 num = 2 Then first = 2 and Second = INT_MAX
i=1 num = 1 Then first = 1 and Second = INT_MAX
i=2 num = 5 Then first = 1 and Second = 5
i=3 num = 0 Then first = 0 and Second = 5
i=4 num = 4 Then first = 1 and Second = 4
i=5 num = 6 Then first = 1 and Second = 4 now 6 is bigger of both value first and second so we will return true 




class Solution {
public:
    bool increasingTriplet(vector<int>& nums) {
        int first = INT_MAX, second=INT_MAX;
        for(auto& num:nums){
            if(num>second && second>first) return true;
            else if(num<first) first = num;
            else if(num>first) second=num;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
