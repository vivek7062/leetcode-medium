// Question - https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-area/
// Answer in cpp


Approach
Find total area of both rectangle and subtract area of overlap rectangle

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(1)

Space complexity:
O(1)

Code
class Solution {
public:
    int computeArea(int ax1, int ay1, int ax2, int ay2, int bx1, int by1, int bx2, int by2) {
        int first_area = abs(ax2-ax1) * abs(ay2-ay1);
        int second_area = abs(bx2-bx1) * abs(by2-by1);
        int total_area = first_area+second_area;
        int xOverlap = min(ax2, bx2) - max(ax1, bx1);
        int yOverlap = min(ay2, by2) - max(ay1, by1);
        int overlapArea = (xOverlap > 0 && yOverlap > 0) ? xOverlap * yOverlap : 0;
        return total_area-overlapArea;
    }
};
